# Credit card fraud detection
This notebook was an hands-on exercise for the Coursera-IBM course "Machine Learning with Python". Here, I built two popular classification models for recognising fraudulent credit card transactions: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. The dataset contains information on credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The goal is to assess whether a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.
